self balancing robot using arduino

DIY : self balancing robot

The self balancing robot is unstable due to: the design does not pay attention to the load balance center and the type of motor that does not have enough power to withstand the load from the self balancing robot. I think maybe by using the type of material and a lighter load and a large motor power the robot will achieve balance with the help of the gyro sensor.

materials:
arduino nano, l298n motor driver, BO motor & wheel, gyro sensor mpu-6050, breadboard, jumper cable, cardboard
